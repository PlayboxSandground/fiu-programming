/*
*
*
* Problem 2:
Write a program in Java to implement a recursive search function
int terSearch(int A[], int l, int r, int x)
that returns the location of x in a given sorted array of n integers A if x is present, otherwise -1.
The terSearch search function, unlike the binary search, must consider two dividing points
int d1 = l + (r - l)/3
int d2 = d1 + (r - l)/3
For the first call of your recursive search function terSearch you must consider l = 0 and r = A.length - 1.
Important Notes:
- For this problem you must add the main method in your program in order to test your implementation.
- There are no data errors that need to be checked as all the data will be assumed correct.
- Your program MUST be submitted only in source code form (.java file).
- A program that does not compile or does not run loses all correctness points.

/*
*
* Problem 3:
-	Implement a sublinear running time complexity recursive function in Java
public static long exponentiation(long x, int n) to calculate xn.
Note: In your function you can use only the basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, %, and /).
-	What is the running time complexity of your function? Justify.
-	Give a number of multiplications used by your function to calculate x63.
Important Notes:
	For the item (a):
-	you must add the main method in your program in order to test your implementation.
-	there are no data errors that need to be checked as all the data will be assumed correct.
-	your function you can use only the basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, %, and /).
-	Your program MUST be submitted only in source code form (.java file).
-	A program that does not compile or does not run loses all correctness points
